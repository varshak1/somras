Live Composer is a front-end WordPress page builder plugin. But with the free "blank" theme you can build a whole website.

== Description ==

= Front-End WordPress Page Builder =

Live Composer is a front-end WordPress page builder plugin. Front-end means you build the page directly on the page, not in the admin panel, which allows you to see exactly how the page will look like as you build it, with live feedback on every change you make.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to I activate the page builder on a page? =

When you visit a page you'll see a green "activate editor" button in the bottom right corner, click that and the page will reload in LC mode.

= Why is the "activate editor" button missing from the homepage =

In most of the cases this is because the homepage is not a real WordPress page, it’s custom content generated by the theme’s index.php. Publish a new page and set it as the homepage ( WP Admin > Settings > Reading > Front Page ). Now you can use LC on the homepage.
